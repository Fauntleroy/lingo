# Lingo

 Lingo is a linguistics module, currently providing inflection and some string transformations. Eventually I would like to extend its capabilities and add additional languages.

## Installation

    $ npm install lingo

## Usage Information

  Until I have some hand-written docs, view the generated ones [here](http://visionmedia.github.com/lingo).
